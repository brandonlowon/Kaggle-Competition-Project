# Project proposal for Titanic Machine Learning From Disaster : My First Attempt in Competitive Coding Using Machine Learning
Author: *Brandon Low-On*

## 1. Why: Question/Topic being investigated 2pts
The challenge I have chosen is the Titanic: Machine Learning From Disaster. 
The question I am attempt to solve is build a predictive model that answers the question: "What sorts of people were more likely to survive the Titanic sinking?"

I would like to experience the process and journey of competing in a competitve environment. This is an excellent opportunity to familiarize myself with Kaggle and other dataset sets and apply my problem solving skills to real world problems and data.
Overall I think this will be a fun and rewarding experience and hopefully in the future I will tackle future datasets on my own. 


## 2. How: Plan of attack 2pts
Following the guidelines on Kaggle and the steps I have learned in class I will create a notebook to handle this Classification problem. 
My steps that I will loosely follow are:
 - Clean dataset (remove any data columns I deem unncessary with valid reason)
 - Using a simple train-split and models from sklearn obtain a score
 - Improve the accuracy with material learned from class (grids, model parameters, precision curve adjusting and thresholds etc)
 

## 3. What: Dataset, models, framework, components 2pts

The dataset I received is from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

The models I hope to employ in this class are : LogisticRegression, RandomForest, GradientBoosting, and SVC

Helpful functions I believe will be necessary for this project are: LabelEncoders, seaborn plots, correlation heat maps, confusion matrices, cross validation
